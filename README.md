This project is designed to utilise Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to identify and analyze patterns indicative of suicidal ideation in social media texts, specifically Reddit. With the increasing importance of mental health awareness and the critical role social media plays in our daily lives, this project aims to create an automated system that can potentially serve as an early warning mechanism to help prevent suicides by identifying at-risk individuals based on their social media footprint.
